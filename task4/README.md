‚ùì Interview Questions :-
	1.	What is a firewall?
    A security system that filters network traffic based on rules.
	2.	Difference between stateful and stateless firewall?
	‚Ä¢	Stateful: tracks active connections
	‚Ä¢	Stateless: filters packets individually
	3.	Inbound vs Outbound rules?
	‚Ä¢	Inbound: controls traffic coming into your system
	‚Ä¢	Outbound: controls traffic leaving your system
	4.	Why block Telnet (port 23)?
    Telnet is insecure and transmits data unencrypted.
	5.	How does a firewall improve security?
    Reduces attack surface and controls access to services.
	6.	What is NAT in firewalls?
    Network Address Translation hides private IPs and conserves public IPs.
